<h2>ChessBoard</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<div>
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
<br>
&nbsp;# # # #<br>
# # # # <br>
&nbsp;# # # #<br>
# # # # <br>
&nbsp;# # # #<br>
# # # # <br>
&nbsp;# # # #<br>
# # # #<br>
<br>
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
</div>
